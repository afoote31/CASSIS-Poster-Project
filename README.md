# CASSIS Poster Project

This is the code that I used to develop the model and visuals that I presented as a poster at the Cascadia Symposium on Statistics in Sports in Fall 2024. I've written a [blog post](https://afoote31.github.io/blog/2025/testPost/) on my website explaining the project. The post isn't finished but it presents some key ideas.
